## üêñ About Us

Welcome to NCP-Stampede! We are an organization dedicated to creating a flexible, open-source framework that empowers students to build a centralized mobile app for their own high school. Our goal is to make school resources, events, and information easily accessible to everyone in the community.

Our flagship project, the `northside-app`, serves Northside College Prep by consolidating all of the school's scattered resources into a single, convenient application. By making our tools open-source, we aim to provide a blueprint for any student with a computer to create a similar, invaluable resource for their own school.

## üóÉ Our Projects

Our ecosystem is divided into several key repositories:

* **[northside-app](https://github.com/NCP-Stampede/northside-app)**: The official app for Northside College Prep. It serves as a practical implementation of our open-source packages and aims to consolidate all school resources, announcements, and event information in one place for easy access.

* **[hs-app-toolkit](https://github.com/NCP-Stampede/hs-app-toolkit)**: The open-source Python backend package. This toolkit provides the scraping and data processing capabilities needed to gather information for the app. It is designed to be adaptable for any school's website structure.

* **[frontend-package](https://github.com/NCP-Stampede/frontend-package)**: The open-source Dart frontend package. This package contains the reusable UI components and framework for building the mobile app, allowing for quick development and a consistent user experience.

* **[NCP-Stampede.github.io](https://github.com/NCP-Stampede/NCP-Stampede.github.io)**: The official documentation for the entire project. Here you'll find guides on how to use our packages to build an app for your own school.
